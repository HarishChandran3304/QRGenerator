# QRGenerator
Generates QR codes for free. (idk why ppl charge for this)

I haven't found a free and snappy QR code generator online. So I made this. This is a quick hack and we can add more features if needed.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Make the generation colourful using some huggingface models like [this](https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface-projects/QR-code-AI-art-generator)
- [ ] More customization options (size, orientation ...)
